      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Turkey meatballs with zucchini baked right in. We make them into large
        meatballs because they are basically a meal in and of themselves, but
        feel free to make them into smaller sizes! Also great with pesto and
        tomatoes!

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded zucchini</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 slices multigrain bread, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 pound 93% lean ground turkey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a
          9x13-inch baking pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat vegetable oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute
          zucchini and onion until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic; cook
          for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let mixture cool to room
          temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Soak bread in a small bowl with milk until milk is absorbed, about 2
          minutes. Remove bread and gently squeeze out excess milk. Place bread
          in a food processor and pulse until mixture forms fine crumbs
          resembling wet sand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine ground turkey with the sauteed zucchini mixture, bread crumbs,
          oregano, salt, pepper, and nutmeg in a large bowl. Add eggs, Parmesan
          cheese, and parsley; mix thoroughly. Form mixture into 12 large
          meatballs using a large ice cream scoop.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place 1/3 cup flour in a shallow dish. Dredge meatballs in flour and
          place 1 inch apart in the prepared baking pan. Drizzle olive oil over
          meatballs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are lightly browned on top
          and no longer pink in the center, 30 to 38 minutes. An instant-read
          thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball should read at
          least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).
